This project demonstrates the use of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for synthetic data generation to tackle the problem of class imbalance in credit card fraud detection.

Project Overview
The notebook is structured into two main parts:
  - Baseline Model and Data Analysis:
    - Load and analyze the credit card dataset.
    - Visualize class distribution and understand the imbalance.
    - Train a baseline Logistic Regression model on the imbalanced dataset.

  - GMM for Synthetic Sampling:
    - Fit GMM on minority class data to learn its distribution.
    - Generate synthetic samples to balance the dataset.
    - Evaluate the impact of synthetic sampling on model performance.

Key Features
 - Data Visualization: Understand the class imbalance using bar plots and pie charts.
 - Baseline Model: Establish a benchmark using Logistic Regression.
 - GMM Implementation: Use AIC/BIC to determine optimal components for GMM.
 - Synthetic Data Generation: Create realistic samples to balance the dataset.
  - Model Evaluation: Compare performance metrics before and after balancing.
